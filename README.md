# bcard
digital bussiness card for everyone.

In the main page ('/') you can create your account.
Your password is being encrypted using the bcrypt library, even I can't see it.
You get your own special key that randomly generated, which connects you to your account.

After you created your account, it's time to create your b-card!
Go ahead to /create, and start filling the fields, upload your logo and hit the create button - congrats! a new bcard has just born!

After that, you can manage your bcard through the /dashboard page.
There you have your basic information such as the amount of views your bcard got, a link to your bcard, and a QR code to share easily with your friends!
